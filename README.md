# Home-Loan-Approval-Prediction

I have just completed a Python project focused on Machine Learning. The topic of this project is to determine whether a bank should grant a loan to a client or not. Dream Housing Finance company wishes to automate the loan eligibility process based on the details provided by the client in the online application form.

Firstly, I analyzed and prepared the data using techniques such as imputation and encoding. Next, I will choose a prediction model using various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. I will also optimize the model to improve its performance.

The ultimate goal of this project is to provide Dream Housing Finance company with an accurate and reliable model to assist them in making informed decisions when granting home loans.
